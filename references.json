Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods, such as supervised learning and label propagation, that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine-learning technique across fields, supervised learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype- or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label propagation, the widely benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a classic label propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised learning on a gene’s full network connectivity outperforms label propagaton and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label propagation’s appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node embeddings (derived using node2vec), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity. These results show that supervised learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title><jats:p>The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Contact</jats:title><jats:p>arjun@msu.edu</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title><jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>By classifying patients into subgroups, clinicians can provide more effective care than using a uniform approach for all patients. Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist—and most support diverse hyperparameters—so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 52 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection using nested cross validation. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms typically outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies.</jats:p>",
