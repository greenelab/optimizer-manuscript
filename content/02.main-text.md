**A.** Performance vs. model complexity (number of nonzero coefficients) for EGFR mutation status prediction, for liblinear and SGD optimizers. Bins are derived from deciles of coefficient count distribution across optimizers; additional detail in Methods. "Holdout" dataset is used in panels B/C for best-performing model selection, "test" data is completely held out from model selection.
**B.** Distribution of performance difference between best-performing model for liblinear and SGD optimizers, across all 84 genes in Vogelstein driver gene set. Positive numbers on the x-axis indicate better performance using liblinear, and negative numbers indicate better performance using SGD.
**C.** Distribution of nonzero coefficients for best-performing models using each optimizer, across genes.
